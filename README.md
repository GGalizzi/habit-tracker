## Habit Tracker

Habit Tracker is an app made in [Node-Webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).

The porpuse of the app is (or will be) to keep track of habits you want to get into, to be able to improve oneself.

It'll have several features to help out, working similar to [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/), but more straightforward and less gamified (though, there still is some of that).

It is also inspired by some really good advice given on a couple ( [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72) | [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) ) of [/r/GetDiscplined](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/), it will follow some of the rules and principles laid out here, as well as personal ideas and rules.
